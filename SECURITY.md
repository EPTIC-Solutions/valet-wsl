## Reporting a Vulnerability

We class a vulnerability to be any exploit or unexpected behaviour that has an impact on the application's performance or makes the application behave in an unintended way.

If a new vulnerability is found you should always create a new [bug report](https://github.com/EPTIC-Solutions/valet-wsl/issues/new).
